The solution involved two main steps:

1. **Improved Error Handling in Native Modules:** The native modules (Objective-C and Java) were modified to include more robust error handling. Instead of silently failing, the modules now explicitly catch exceptions and log detailed error messages.  This allowed us to identify the root cause of the failure. 

2. **Conditional Initialization:** The initialization logic of the native module was made conditional. Before initializing, the module checks if it's running within the Expo development environment.  This prevents certain initialization steps that are not suitable for the physical device build process.

Example (Objective-C snippet):

```objectivec
- (BOOL)isInitialized {
    return _isInitialized;
}

- (void)initialize {
    if ([self isExpoGoEnvironment]) {
       // Initialize for Expo Go
    } else {
       // Initialize for device build, add more sophisticated error handling
       // Example with improved error handling:
       @try {
           //Perform the Initialization steps which were failing before
       } @catch (NSException *exception) {
           NSLog("Native Module Initialization Failed: %@
", exception);
           //Handle the error appropriately, e.g., log the error to a file, fall back to a default state etc. 
       }
    }
    _isInitialized = YES;
}
```

By implementing these changes, the vague error message was replaced with more specific error information, making it significantly easier to debug and solve the underlying problem.
