# Expo CLI Build Error: Vague Error with Custom Native Module

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while building an Expo project with a custom native module. The issue occurs when building for physical devices or emulators, resulting in a vague error message that is difficult to debug.

The project includes the problematic code (`bug.js`) and a solution (`bugSolution.js`) that addresses the error. The solution involves more explicit error handling within the native module and careful checking of the environment during initialization.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Attempt to build the app for a physical device or emulator using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`.
5. Observe the vague error message.
6. Apply the solution in `bugSolution.js` and rebuild.

## Bug and Solution Files

- `bug.js`: Contains the original problematic code.
- `bugSolution.js`: Contains the corrected code that addresses the error.

## Further investigation might be needed on the native side, and the exact error message needs to be provided for a more targeted solution.
