While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the interaction between Expo's development server and a custom native module.  The error message was vague, mentioning a problem with the module's initialization but not providing specific details. This occurred only when running the app on a physical device or emulator, not in the Expo Go app. The native module was written in Objective-C (iOS) and Java (Android). The code itself appeared to be correct.
